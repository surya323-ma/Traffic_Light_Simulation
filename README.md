# Traffic_Light_Simulation
🚦 Optimizing Traffic with Reinforcement Learning! 🧠

🔍 Objective: Teach an RL agent to intelligently learn the most efficient traffic light durations – and it successfully converged to the golden set: (20s, 20s, 35s, 35s) across 4 traffic light phases.

💡 What’s inside? ✅ Q-value convergence plots ✅ Neural network with 2 hidden layers (64 → 32 neurons) ✅ 4 distinct traffic phase actions ✅ Smart reward system based on waiting time ✅ Full training setup with verification

📈 Bonus: Visuals, modular design, and real-world deployment potential using SUMO simulation!
